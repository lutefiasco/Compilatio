Henry VIII (b. 1491, d. 1547) read the inventory and marked those manuscripts which he desired for the Royal Library with a cross: the selected manuscripts include Thornton Abbey’s copy of theGestis Pontificum Anglorum(see Liddell, \'\'Leland\'s\' Lists’ (1939), p. 91). At the Royal Library, the manuscript’s passages on councils, the authority of bishops and the Pope, and consanguinity in marriage were examined by scholars for theCollectanea satis copiosa(The Sufficiently Abundant Collections): a collection of learned texts compiled in 1530-1531 that justified Henry VIII\'s independence from Rome. Carley suggests that Harley MS 2’s copy of the Constitutions of Clarendon of 1164, listed to explain the cause of Thomas of Canterbury’s exile and martyrdom, may have been the immediate source for the articles that are quoted from the Constitutions in theCollectanea(see Carley, ‘William of Malmesbury’ (2009), p. 140 (no. 132)). The marginal notes that highlight passages throughout the manuscript were added in the Royal Library, possibly by Henry VIII himself: e.g. the passage on consanguinity in marriage on f. 130r (see Carley, ‘Marks in Books’ (1997), p. 591 n. 25).

John Patteson encountered financial difficulties in the second decade of the 19th century, and in 1820 he sold the Macro manuscripts to London bookseller James Christie (1773-1831).

It is not known when the Tollemache family acquired MS Add. 9213; according to Edwards and Griffiths the Tollemache family seems to have began assembling a private library by the mid-16th century, and subsequent generations continued to acquire manuscripts and rare books. The 1993 Sotheby catalogue description suggests that the the manuscript was \'probably bound for Sir Lionel Tollemache (1649-1727), 1648-1726 (!) , third earl of Dysart\', which would place the family\'s acquisition of the volume before 1727.

Edwards and Griffiths tentatively suggested that the \'Liber Medicines Abubecri\' might be their \'MS 64\', now Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania, Library, Lawrence J.

Many of the connections between these names and specific individuals were first put forward by John Manly and Edith Rickert (1940), but the evidence is often tenuous and the connections speculative, and they remain the subject of some debate.

West], unidentified owner(s) or reader(s): their names inscribed in the same hand from the 15th century or early 16th-century on f. 134r : "Tomas West / Margry"; perhaps identifiable with Thomas West, 8th Baron De La Warr (c. 1457-1525), and his sister Margery West, and referred to in the two inscriptions on the same page: "My lady la Warr" (seemingly in the same hand as their names), and "My lord La warr" (probably written in a different and earlier hand). "Thallmache", unidentified owner or reader: their family name written in a late 15th- or early 16th-century hand on f. 134r . Pearsall and Mooney, A Descriptive Catalogue (2021), p. 29, suggest that this may refer to the Tollemache family of Helmingham in Suffolk.

James of Carrigart, unidentified owner or reader: his name occuring five times in a 16th-century hand on f. 134r : "James de Carricart" and "James de Carriquart", perhaps an Anglicisation of Carraig Airt, Kilmacrennan, Donegal, Ireland, or Carreg y Garth, Carernarfon, Gwynedd, Wales. Christofer Whitton, unidentified owner or reader: his name inscribed in a 16th-century hand on f. 134r . Magister [Master] Asshe, unidentified: owned the manuscript probably in the first half of the 16th century. Donated the manuscript to Thomas Curson, according to an inscription on f. ii recto (see below). Thomas Curson (d. 1555), of Waterperry, Oxfordshire, Clerk Comptroller of the Queen\'s Household (see Kew, The National Archives, PROB-11-37-352 ): his name inscribed with a Latin motto on f. i verso , his ownership inscription on f. ii recto : "Master Thomas Curson ys the Honour of this booke ex dono Magistri Asshe", followed by a note about his donation of the manuscript with his signature (see below). Ambrose Belson, son of William Belson and Anne Curson, the sister of Thomas Curson, to whose second wife Agnes Saunders (d. before 1588) Ambrose was a servant and from whom he received the manuscript according to an inscription on f. ii recto : "Ambrose Belson is the honor of this boke of the gyfete of Mr Cursson - Thomas Cursson - Ambrose Belson". His signature ("Belson") inscribed in the lower margin of f. 115r . John Barton, owned the manuscript in the second half of the 16th century: his ownership inscription with a note that he received the manuscript from Ambrose Belson on f. ii recto : "Liber J [?F] Barton ex dono Ambrosij Belson". Perhaps the same "John Barton" who inscribed his name in squiggly lines on f. 134r . Eliza or Elizabeth Hampden, possibly the daughter of Edmund Hampden (d. 1577) and Isabel Curson (fl. 1577-1588), and great-niece of the aforementioned Thomas Curson and Anne Curson: her name written upside down in a late 16th-century or 17th-century hand in the upper margin of f. 57r .

On the tomb in which Henry and Elizabeth are buried in Westminster Abbey, Henry\'s arms are presented above, with these impaled arms below. In such a context, presenting a \'joint\' coat of arms in addition to Henry\'s would presumably have been redundant, thus raising the possibility that the impaled arms are indicative not of joint ownership but rather of Elizabeth\'s personal possession of this manuscript.

A William Walter (d. 1523) was known to Henry VII, whom he briefly served as an envoy at the papal curia in the late 1490s. This Walter had studied at Bologna earlier in that decade and was subsequently recorded as doctor of canon and civil law there; he spent the last two decades of his life as archdeacon of Brecon. The word \'llinpenff\' bears the hallmarks of an as yet unidentified Welsh placename that began \'Llyn...\' (meaning \'lake\'), which is also suggestive of a possible connection between this manuscript and this Walter. Another William Walter (fl. c. 1525-1533), poet and translator, was alive around this time. He may have been the owner of London, British Library, MS Sloane 1686, f. 1r , a copy of the Canterbury Tales, which bears an ownership inscription matching his name, written in a later, different style of handwriting to the inscription found in MS Ii.5.11.

Addition of impaled coat of arms of the Tilney and Thorpe families (f. 2v ) indicates that the manuscript was later in Norfolk, later in the 15th and/or in the early 16th centuries. Additions and notes relating to members of the Roberts family indicate the manuscript was in Middlesex, certainly during the second half of the 16th century and perhaps for longer: f. 33r : \'The tyme of Byrth of Thomas Robertz Children\', with dates of birth ranging from 1508 to 1531. f. 109v : further dates of birth for Roberts family children, with dates ranging from 1550 to 1574. The individuals named may have possessed or accessed the manuscript, individually or jointly, and at varying times, however the only evidence that points more firmly towards ownership are the recurrent additions and inscriptions by Thomas Roberts (1470-1542) and Edmund Roberts (1521-1585) of Willesden. The latter wrote his name in many places, usually across openings that contain miniatures, and often with the date 1553, which may be when he acquired the book (ff. 4r , 33v-34r , 37v-38r , 44v-45r , 54r , etc). f. 103v : a further inscription relating to a child\'s date of birth, probably made by a parent or other family member and perhaps after the manuscript had left the possession of the Roberts family: \'Memorandum that Anne Barnesdale was borne 16 day of September 1588 on a Monday\'.

XIV, in London, Brit. Lib., Harley 460). After Charles Theyer\'s unsuccessful efforts to offer the books to Oxford University, they passed to the London bookseller Robert Scott. A catalogue compiled in 1678 (London, Brit. Lib., Royal Appendix 70) does not list Add. 10052-HM 112-Add. 10053; this collection was purchased by Charles II and passed with the Royal Library to the British Museum. The manuscript which is now Add. 10052, HM 112 and Add. 10053 may have been split up and bound separately by 1807, date of Richard Heber\'s purchase of Add. 10053 (since he purchased Add. 10052 only in 1819). HM 112 may have received its present binding while in the possession of George Offor (1787-1864), since the date of 1824 is on the paper flyleaves that contain an account of the text signed by Offor.

Payne Collier, presumably meaning that Collier obtained the transcription or had it done, rather than copying it himself, as the script does not resemble other examples of Collier\'s handwriting in the Huntington Library.
